How to run our program:-

1)  A text file containing the input message must be created.

2)  Call the method by the name "customHuffmanTest(fileName)" and pass it the path of the created input text file.

                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OR ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                    ""this method is used to generate the average time Only""

1)  Call the method by the name "testHuffman(additionFactor, maxLength, nbIterations)" and pass it the the 
    additionFactor which it adds by after each sample test and the maxLength which is the maximum length 
    possible for it to reach and the nbIterations which determines the number of test ran on a singular 
    sample size before taking the average. ( read method discreption )

Note:   an additional run is added which is discarded and not factored within the average calculation as 
        to account for the possiblity of delayes due to load time of the code to the cashes.

2)  A text file by the name "testOutput.txt" will be created if it doesn't exist already and it will 
    house the averege time taken for each sample to complete.

Note:   The file by the name "HuffmanTree.dot" is used for visualzation of the huffman tree but only works if the 
        elements which are within the Huffman tree can be understood by the visulazation language.
